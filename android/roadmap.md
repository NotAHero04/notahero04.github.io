PojavLauncher is always looking to improve itself with better compatibility, smoother gameplay, and more features for you to enjoy.

### Better compatibility for PojavLauncher Android
PojavLauncher Android is using OpenGL 2.1 and Java 8, which cannot support Minecraft 1.17 because of the migration to OpenGL 3.2 in version 21w10a and Java 16 in 21w19a. We are working very hard and currently having several possible solutions targets different Android devices.
